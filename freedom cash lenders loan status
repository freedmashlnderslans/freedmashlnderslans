Title Loan: A title loan has some similarities to a pawnshop loan. The big difference is that a title loan only accepts a paid-off vehicle as collateral.
With a title loan, you hand your vehicleâ€™s title over to the lender. This can be a car, truck, motorcycle, boat, or anything with a clear title of ownership. You also pay the lender a fee for the loan. Typically you have 30 days to pay off the loan. If you do not, the lender retains ownership of the vehicle and you lose all rights to it.
